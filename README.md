# ZMachine

**ZMachine** is me following along with Eric Lippert's OCaml [z-machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) series, but in Swift

Starts looking for your `.z3` files relative to `~/documents`.

There are a few hacks in `Extensions.swift` to make the code more similar to the OCaml, and the code is definitely not idiomatic Swift in many places, but it's a fun learning excercise!

This is not endorsed in any way by anyone.
