# ZMachine

**ZMachine** is me following along with Eric Lippert's OCaml z-machine series, but in Swift

Starts looking for your `.z3` files relative to `~/documents`.

There are a few hacks in Extensions.swift to make the code more similar to OCaml, and the code is definitely not idiomatic Swift in many places, but it's a fun learning excercise!
